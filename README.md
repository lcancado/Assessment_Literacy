##Understanding Normative and Criterion-referenced Interpretation of Assessment Results

This interactive module was designed to help clarify some of the concepts related to educational assessment. This module is part of a larger effort sponsored by the Center for Assessment to use high-fidelity and interactive web-technologies to help improve assessment literacy. 

The use of explorable explanations was inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/). For the visualizations, we use the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library created by Mike Bostock (http://bost.ocks.org/mike/).
