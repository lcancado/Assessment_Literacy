##Understanding Norm- and Criterion-referenced Interpretation of Assessment Results

This interactive module was designed to help clarify some of the concepts related to educational assessment. This module is part of a larger effort sponsored by the [Center for Assessment](http://www.nciea.org/) to use high-fidelity and interactive Web technologies to help improve assessment literacy. 

The use of explorable explanations was inspired by [Bret Victor](http://worrydream.com/ExplorableExplanations/). For the visualizations, we use the [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) library created by [Mike Bostock](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/) and the [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/) library.

-> This is a work in progress - ETA is end of July, 2015 <-
