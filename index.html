  <center><h2>Norm-referenced and Criterion-referenced <br>Interpretation of Test Results</h2></center>

<br>

<p>Results from tests or assessments can be used to make different types of decisions. The specific decision we want to make based on a test result will determine how we interpret the test results.</p>

<p>Sometimes we want to compare students with their peers or rank-order them. When we use tests to make this type of decision we say we are making a <b>norm-referenced</b> or <b>normative</b> interpretation of test results.</p>

<p>Some tests are used to evaluate a person's mastery of a subject, usually by using cut-scores to define proficiency or pass/fail decisions. When tests are used to decide if a student meets a certain pre-defined standard or criteria, we say we are making a <b>criterion-referenced</b> interpretation of test results.</p>

<p>In this interactive module we will use an explorable example to learn the basic <span class="keyTerm">concepts</span>, <span class="keyTerm">uses</span>, and <span class="keyTerm">limitations</span> of both norm-referenced and criterion-referenced interpretations of test results.  </p>

<br>
<center><h3>Mary Masters Math</h3></center>

<br>
<p>Mary is a 9th grade student at ABC High School and she just took the final Math I test.</p> 

<p>The results from this test will be used to:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Determine if 9th grade students mastered Math I concepts or need remediation before moving on to Math II.</li>	
		<ul> <li>The <b>minimum score</b> needed to move on to Math II without remediation is <b>35</b>.</li>
		</ul>	
	<br>
	<li>Give prizes to the top performing 9th grade students in Math I at ABC High.</li>
		<ul> <li> To get a prize a student must rank in the <b>top 10 percent</b> of <b>all 9th grade students</b> in Math I at ABC High.</li>
		</ul>
</ul>

<br>


<p class="question"><span class="question">How can we use Mary's test score to decide if she can move on to Math II without remediation? How can we use that same score to decide if she will receive a prize for being a top performer in comparison to her schoolmates? </span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><b>Let's find out!</b></p>


<br>

<p>Some details about our example:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The test contains 50 questions and each question is worth 1 point.</li>
	<li>Each 9th grade class has a total of 20 students.</li>
	<li>The high school, ABC High, has five 9th grade classes with a total of <span class="keyTerm">100</span> ninth grade students.</li>
	<li>ABC High has records from all students who took this test for the past 10 years.</li>	
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Raw Score and Scaled Score</h3>

<p id="scoring">Mr. Smith, Mary's math teacher, computes the Math I test score by counting the <b>number of correct</b> answers, with no penalty for incorrect responses. We call the <span class="keyTerm">number correct</span> a <b>raw score</b> because it is based solely on the number of correctly answered items on the test.</p>

<p>A raw score might be difficult to interpret and compare since tests can have different numbers of questions and total numbers of points. A simple way to make sense of a raw score is to put it on a percent scale. When we transform the raw score into <span class="keyTerm">percent correct</span> we produce a <b>scaled score</b>.</p>


<p>If a student got <span data-var="numCorrect" class="TKAdjustableNumber" data-min="0" data-max="50"> questions</span> right out of  50 on the test, the student would score <b><span data-var="pctCorrectExample" data-format="%.0f"></span>%</b> correct on the test. </p> 


<p>In our example, let's assume Mary got <b><span data-var="numCorrectMary"> </span></b> correct questions (raw score) or <b><span data-var="pctCorrectMary"></span>%</b> correct (scaled score) on the test.</p>

<p style="font-style: italics; text-align: center;"><span class="question">Does this score tell you if she won any of the Math prizes?</span></p>



<!--
<p><font color=red>Activity 1:</font> Suppose Mary took two tests and her final score will be highest of the two. If she got 53 out of 60 total points on the first test and 45 out of 50 on the second, which test will be used to compute her final score?</p>
<p>Use the calculator below to check your answer.</p>

<br>
<br>


<p class="question"><b>No!</b> We don't know if Mary won a prize because her raw and percent correct scores tell us nothing about how her score compares to her schoolmates.</p>



<br>

<h3>Norm-referenced Scores and Interpretations</h3>


<p> In order to know how one student's score compares to other students who took the same test we must have a <b>norm-referenced</b> score. </p>
<p>A norm-referenced score typically indicates the examinee's <span class="keyTerm">relative position</span> in a group of test takers that we want to compare the examinee's score with. Once we have information about this group we are able to answer the questions above.</p>

<p>A basic ranking in terms of raw or scaled scores can start to give us a better picture of how Mary's performance compares to that of her classmates.</p>

<!--
<p>[<font color=blue>Graphic 2:</font> Mary's raw score compared to her classmates]</p>
-->

<p><font color=red>Activity 1:</font> You may sort the values in the graph below to see how Mary ranked in her class in terms of both raw and percent correct scores. <span class="question">Is Mary in the top 10% of her class?</span></p>


<label>Score type:</label> <select id="rawscore" type='select' onchange='updateData();'>
   <option value='50' id='score' selected='true'>Number Correct</option>
   <option value='100' id='pctCorrect'>Percent Correct</option>   
</select>


<center>
	<input class="sortRaw" id="sortRaw" type="checkbox" value="sort">Sort</input> 
</center>

<div class="rawScoreGraph" style="height:100%;"></div>
<script src="raw_score_chart.js"></script>



<p>There are 20 students in Mary's class, so to place in the top 10% she would need to be one of the top 2 students in her class. Looking at the sorted chart above we can see that <span class="keyTerm">Mary did not rank in the top 10% of her class</span>.</p>

<p class="question" style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Can Mary still win a Math I prize?</p>


<br>

<p>To answer this question we first need to define Mary's <span class="keyTerm">norm group</span>. A <b>norm group</b> is any group we wish to make comparisons against.</p>

<p>In order to quickly understand how a particular score compares to other scores in a norm group we usually use a type of norm-referenced score called <b>percentile rank</b>. If a raw score of 15 correspond to a percentile of 30, it means that 30% of the norm group had raw scores lower than 15. Similarly, when we say that a student's score is at the 80th percentile we are saying that the student's performance on the test was equal to or better than 80% of the students in the norm group.</p>

<p><span class="keyTerm">Percentile ranks are different from percent correct scores!</span> The percentile rank indicates a student's relative standing in a group. The percent correct score indicates what percent of the total possible points a student got on a test. </p>



<!--
<p>In high-stakes national or state standardized tests, the norm group must be <span class="keyTerm">representative</span> of the national or state population of students taking the same test.</p>
<p>To be valid, group comparisons should be made between similar students (e.g., the percent of children learning English should be the same in the norm and comparison groups). </p>

<h3>Types of Norm-referenced Scores</h3>

<p>There are different types of norm-referenced scores. The most common are:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Percentile rank:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Is a simple way of ranking a raw score to the performance of a particular norm group.</li>
			<li>Always run from 1 to 99.</li>
			<li>Define the percent of the norm group which achieved lower scores.</li>
			<li>Each percentile table only refers to one specific norm group at the specific time it was tested.</li>
			<li>If a raw score of 15 correspond to a percentile of 30, it means that 30% of the norm group had raw scores lower than 15.</li>  
		</ul>
	</li>
	<br><br>
	

	Since percentile ranks indicate various percentages of individuals above and below scores that are normally distributed, they do not represent equal units. Percentile ranks are much more compactly arranged in the middle of the normal distribution since that is where the majority of individuals fall.
	
	
	<li><b>Standard score:</b> 
		<ul>
			<li>Is a transformation of the raw score whose score distribution in a specified population has convenient, known values for the mean and standard deviation.</li>
			<li>Often this term is used to specifically denote scores transformed to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 (also known as z-scores).</li>
			<li>Allows the direct comparison of examinees by placement of the scores on a common scale and, for this reason, are useful for comparisons over time.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>Criterion-referenced Scores and Interpretations</h3>


<p>Placement, mastery or pass/fail decisions are usually made by comparing the student's performance on a test against a fixed set of pre-determined criteria or learning standards. </p>

<p>Test performance is summarized as the student's test score, and the pre-determined criteria is usually defined as a minimum <b>cut-score</b> that the student must obtain to demonstrate proficiency in the subject matter.</p>

<p>When we compare test scores against a cut-score to make placement, mastery or pass/fail decisions we are making a <b>criterion-referenced</b> interpretation.</p>


<br>

<!--
<h3>cut-scores</h3>

<p>A <b>cut-score</b> is a point on the test score scale used for classifying the test takers into groups on the basis of their scores.</p>
<p> In general, criterion-referenced tests involve a cut-score where the examinee passes if his or her score exceeds the cut-score and fails if it does not. However, <span class="keyTerm">the criterion is not the cut-score</span>, the criterion is the domain of subject matter that the test is designed to assess.</p> 

<p>In some cases, tests may have multiple cut-scores representing tiered levels of proficiency such as <span class="question">basic</span>, <span class="question">proficient</span>, or <span class="question">advanced</span>. cut-scores may also be applied in certification and licensing exams that are used to determine whether examinees are professionally <span class="question">"qualified"</span>.</p>


<p>Most criterion-referenced assessments use a <b>cut-score</b> which determines success or failure based on a pre-established percent correct. Criterion-referenced scores tell us how well the examinee performed against an objective or standard, as opposed to against other examinees. For example, a driver's test intends to determine whether a person is knowledgeable and capable enough to be allowed on the road, not whether one driver is more accomplished than another.</p>


<br>
<h3>Standard Setting</h3>

<p>The process used to determine cut-scores is formally known as <b>standard setting</b>.</p> 

<p>Who defines the cut-score?</p>

<ul>
	<li>For tests such as teacher designed classroom assessments, cut-scores might be defined by the teacher.</li>
	<li>For final exams, cut-scores might be defined by the school.</li>
	<li>For commercial and high-stakes tests, the test developer will form a standard-setting panel by recruiting a group of experts, such as psychometricians (specialists in the science of educational measurement) or teachers from a relevant content area. The panel will then use one or more research-based methods, developed by psychometricians and academics, for setting testing standards and determining cut-scores.</li>
</ul>

However, 11 students in Mary's class did not meet the predefined criteria and will need remediation before being eligible to enroll in Math II.</p>


<br>
<br>
<h3>Combining Norm- and Criterion-referenced Interpretations</h3>

<p>Generally speaking, it is not the test but the interpretation of its results that is norm-referenced or criterion-referenced. A test might have been built to provide criterion-referenced interpretation of a student's mastery of a subject but after many administrations it could be used to make a norm-referenced interpretation, that is, to compare the student's performance to that of other test-takers.</p>

<p>Additionally, we can, and often do, interpret a single test score both in terms of norm- and criterion-referencing.</p>

<br>

<p><font color=red>Activity 4:</font> Now we will look at some sample questions that use both criterion-referenced and norm-referenced interpretation of test scores to apply the knowledge you have gained in this module.</p>

<!--
<p>Suppose now that the decision about advancing students to Math II depents on their percentile rank. Only students who scored at the top 70th percentile will advance to Math II. How many students in Mary's class and in the school were able to advance based on this criterion?
	The 70th percentile was chosen arbitrarily. Select another cut percentile and see how it impacts who advances to the next Math level.
</p>
<p>Now suppose that the prizes will be given to all students who had a score of 95% or better in the Math I test. How many students got the prize based on this criteria? Did Mary win a prize? </p>

<p>You might be starting to realize that norm and criterion-referenced interpretations are distinct from norm- and criterion referenced scores. You can use norm-referenced scores to make a criterion-referenced decision. We did that when we decided that students at the 70th percentile would advance to Math II.</p>

<p>Now suppose that there are only 2 Math II classes with 20 spots each, so only 40 students will be able to avance to Math II. Students must still meet the defined cut-score for proficiency but we will have to select the top 40 students who met this criteria. We now must use both the norm-referenced and the criterion-referenced scores to decide who will advance.</p>

<!--
<br>	
<p>Uses and limitations of <b>norm-referenced</b> scores:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In order to make norm-referenced interpretations, the norm group must be representative of the population of examinees we want to compare to.</li>
	<li>Norm-referenced scores are usually used to identify specific learning disabilities, such as autism, dyslexia, or nonverbal learning disability, or to determine eligibility for special-education services.</li>
	<li>Reporting results in terms of percentiles or standard scores does not provide information on whether or not the students were proficient.</li>
	<li>It is possible that all students performed poorly and that none are proficient or that all are proficient.</li>
	<li>Rank ordering the student scores does not necessarily reflect an amount of knowledge and skills measured by the test.</li>
</ul>

<p>Uses and limitations of <b>criterion-referenced</b> scores:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Every student taking the test could theoretically fail if they don't meet the expected standard; alternatively, every student could earn the highest possible score.</li>
	<li>It is not only possible, but usually desirable, for every student to pass the test or earn a perfect score.</li>
	<li>These scores are used to report how well students are doing relative to a pre-determined performance level on a specified set of educational goals or outcomes included in the school, district, or state curriculum.</li>
	<li>Scores may be used as one piece of information to determine how well the student is learning the desired curriculum and how well the school is teaching that curriculum.</li>
</ul>

<p>"Although loads of educators refer to "criterion-referenced tests" and "norm-referenced tests," there are, technically, no such creatures. Rather, there are criterion- and norm-referenced interpretations of students' test performances. For example, educators in a school district might have built a test to yield criterion-referenced interpretations, used the test for several years and, in the process, gathered substantial data regarding the performances of district students. As a consequence, the district's educators could build normative tables permitting norm-referenced interpretations of the test which, although born to provide criterion-referenced inferences, can still permit meaningful norm-referenced interpretations."
